## Wine Overview

This is an R Markdown document, in which we have analyzed the Wine Reviews Dataset from Kaggle. 

see <https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews>, a CSV version of the data scraped.

Our main goals are to visualize and analyze Wine Review Dataset using a multiple of visualising tools taught in class. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>% 
  count(country) %>% 
  mutate(Country = factor(country)) %>% 
  top_n(11) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Country, n)) +
  geom_col() +  
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wine %>% 
  top_n(200) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = country, y = price)) +
  theme_minimal()

wine %>% 
  top_n(1100) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = country, y = price, fill = country)) 
```

Italy, Turkey and Slovenia wines, on average, the most expensive wine.

## Wines Production of Countries

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wines_of_countries <- wine["country"]
barplot(table(wines_of_countries),
        main = "Wines Production of Countries",
        xlab = "Countries",
        ylab = "Production",
        border = "black",
        col = "pink",
        axes = TRUE,
        density = 21, 
        cex.axis = .6, 
        cex.names = .6,
        las = 2) +
  theme_minimal()
```
Above graph tells us the countries that a variety of wines are from and their production.

Obviously, US and France produced most of the wines (US 42% and France 17%  and other 42 countries 41%, derived from summary(wine) above).
